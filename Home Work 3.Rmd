### Regular expression Puzzles


#### **Question 1**
```
Find: "\s* \s" 

Replace: ","
```

**Explanation:** The goal of this regex is to convert whitespace-separated text into CSV format. It finds one or more spaces before and after another space and replaces them with a comma.


#### **Question 2**
```
Find: "(\w+), (\w+), ((.+)$)" 

Replace: "\2 \1 (\3)"
```

**Explanation:** This regex captures three groups: two words and the remaining line. The replacement reorders them and wraps the third group in parentheses.


#### **Question 3**
```
Find: "(\d{4})" 

Replace: "\n(\1)"
```

**Explanation:** This expression locates any sequence of four digits and replaces it with the same digits on a new line, enclosed in parentheses.


#### **Question 4**
```
Find: "(\d{4})\s+(.*?)(\.mp3)" 

Replace: "\2_(\1\3)"
```

**Explanation:** This regex removes a 4-digit prefix and any following whitespace from a filename. It then moves the number to the end and renames the file with the pattern: title_(year.mp3).


#### **Question 5**
```
Find: "(\w)(?:\w*),(\w+),(\d+(?:\.\d+)?),(\d+)" 

Replace: "\1_\2,\4"
```

**Explanation:**
This regex targets rows with four comma-separated fields: two words, a decimal number, and an integer. It abbreviates the first word to its first letter, appends an underscore, retains the second word and last number, and drops the decimal value.


#### **Question 6**
```
Find: "(\w)(?:\w*),(\w{4})\w*,\d+(?:\.\d+)?,(\d+)"  

Replace: "\1_\2,\3"
```

**Explanation:** This pattern captures the first letter of the first word, the first four letters of the second word, and the last integer. It formats the result as: firstLetter_fourLetters,lastNumber.


#### **Question 7**
```
Find: "(\w{3})\w*,(\w{3})\w*,\d+(?:\.\d+)?,(\d+)" 

Replace: "\1\2,\3"
```

**Explanation:** This regex extracts the first three letters of the genus and species names, followed by the last number in each line. It rearranges the order in the replacement string.


#### **Question 8**
#### Data Curation Using REGEX

##### a. The pathogen_binary Column
I observed a number of NA values instead of 0s and 1s. I replaced these with 0 using the regex \bNA\b. 

##### b. The *Bombus* spp and Host_spp Columns
There were inconsistencies in species naming, including special characters and underscores. I used [^\w\s\r\n] to remove unwanted characters, and then removed underscores using a separate regex.

##### c. The bee_caste Column
In this column, drones were labeled as "male." I used a regex to search for "male" and replaced it with "drone" for clarity and consistency.
