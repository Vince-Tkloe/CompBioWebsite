I am Vincent Tamakloe, a PhD student in Plant Sciences with a concentration in Applied Chemical Ecology at the University of Vermont. My research focuses on sustainable pest management, particularly exploring pheromone mating disruption in the swede midge (*Contarinia nasturtii*), and I'm passionate about agroecology, plant-insect interactions, chemical ecology, insecticides, and pest management.
